# Open Quantum Safe

The Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project is an open-source project that aims to support the development and prototyping of [quantum-resistant cryptography](https://openquantumsafe.org/post-quantum-crypto.html). OQS is part of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)'s [Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance](https://pqca.org/).

OQS consists of two main lines of work: [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs), an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, and prototype integrations into [protocols and applications](https://openquantumsafe.org/applications/), including a [provider for the widely used OpenSSL library](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider).  These tools support [research](https://openquantumsafe.org/research/) by ourselves and others.

All of our development takes place on our [Github](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe) repositories.  We welcome new contributors interested in joining our team.  We are grateful to the organizations that have supported and continue to support our work, and the academic, industry, public sector, and individual contributors who participate in the project.
